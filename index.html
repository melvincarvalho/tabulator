    <h3><a name="latest">Releases:</a></h3>
<p>Tabulator is now hosted on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5596">addons.mozilla.org</a>. If you download and install from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5596">there</a>, it will provide automatic updates through the Firefox Addon Manager. But make sure you register on the site before downloading the extension (Since the extension is hosted in the "Addons Sandbox", it can only be downloaded by registered users). </p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can download and install the latest release from below. Note that automatic updates will NOT be provided if you use the versions listed below.</p>

    <p>This release includes the "FOAF Pane" which lets you explore friends listed on your FOAF file and the instructions on how to create a "Web ID". It is also possible to create your FOAF file with some seed FOAF data on any WebDAV editable space, and add details later on.<br/> For more information on the background on this work please refer to the position paper <b><a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2008/Papers/MSNWS/">Decentralization : The Future of Social Networking</a></b>. </p>
   <p><i>Note: Make sure you turn on "Tools -> Data Browser -> Make Firefox RDF" upon installing the Firefox Extension. This is required because the FOAF ontology is not loaded if the accept header is not set to request RDF, and some labels will not be displayed properly.</i></p>

        outline mode, for some things identified by several URIs.</li>
        <li>When entering new data, a relationship between the 
        current think and some other thing, there is, at the top of the
        list in the auto-complete menu the "New..." optio which 
        allows you to enter data about something the tabulator
        hasn't seen in the new session. A new URI is made up for the thing,
        in the document in which the data is being stored.
        This functionality has been in some versions, but was not in the last.</li>

    This release is still very alpha.
    While the old features may be more stable, new ones have been added, which
    will be less stable.  But that's more fun, right? This release:
    <ul>
      <li>The system of 'panes' allows multiple views of an object
      in outline view.
        <ul>
        <li>A list of the members of  class;</li>
        <li>The normal view of the properties of a thing;</li>
        <li>A view "under the hood" of what happened when a thing was looked up on the web;</li>
        <li>A social "Friend of a Friend" view of people (see below)</li>
        <li>For an image, the image itself</li>
        <li>For a web page, the web page itself.</li>
        </ul>
        The ones at the top of the list have priority, the first one which
        applies being selected as the default.
      </li>
      <li>The editing interface was different in the extension and online
      versions, they have now been merged, but the merge might not have all the
      features of both.</li>
      <li>There remains a problem when following  link to, or laoding from the URI bar, 
      something which teh server gives a HTTP 303 redirect code.
      (A battle between Tabulator and Firefox).
      Firefox follows the redirect, and so the display
      isnot focussed on the original
      thing; just (all) the information sent back is displayed.
      </li>
      <li>Recently, An embryonic Social Networking view <img
       src="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2007/tab/ext/chrome/content/icons/foaf/foafTiny.gif" />

    <h3><a name="intro">Introduction:</a></h3>
    <p>
    The Tabulator Extension is an extension for Firefox that provides a
     human-readable interface for linked data.
    It is based on the on-line <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab.html">Tabulator</a>,
     a web-based interface for browsing RDF.
    Using Tabulator's outline mode, query views, and back-end code,
     the Tabulator Extension integrates the browsing of linked data directly
      into the Firefox browser, making for a more natural and seamless experience when browsing linked data on the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
    A primary goal of the Tabulator Extension is to explore how linked data could be displayed in the next generation of Web browsers.
    The extension aims to make linked data human-readable by taking a document and picking out the actual <i>things</i> that the document describes.
    The properties of these things are the displayed in a table, and then the links in that table can be followed to load more data about other things in other documents.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Tabulator Extension was originally developed during Summer 2007 by the
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab">Tabulator Team</a>.
    It is open source under the W3C Software License.
    
    </p>
    <h3><a name="install">Installation:</a></h3>
    <p>
    To install the extension, click the download link in the Releases section.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once the extension file is downloaded, it should automatically install.
    After restarting Firefox, all documents served as application/rdf+xml and
    text/n3 will be automatically loaded in the extension's outline view.
    It may be necessary to disable other RDF-related extensions that could override the extension's capture of these documents.
    </p>
